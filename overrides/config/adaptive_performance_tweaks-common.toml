#This sections allows to control specific setting for some mods.
#You don't need to disable any mod support if the mod is not installed.
#In general there are 3 settings per supported mod.
#
# [Enabled] Enables / disables the optimization for this specific Mod.
# [MaxEntityPerPlayer] Defines the max. number of entities of a specific type, which could spawn
#   within the player radius. This value will be adjusted according the server load and game difficulty.
# [MaxEntityPerWorld] Defines the max. number of entities of a specific type, which could spawn
#   within the world. This value will be adjusted according the server load and game difficulty.
#
#Note: A value of 1 means that you can only have one entity of a specific type (e.g. minecraft:creeper)
#at a time. You still could have 2 monster from different types likes minecraft:creeper and
#minecraft:skeleton at the same time.
